# Flask API Server for PTN Outputs

## Overview
This Flask server is configured to serve the outputs of the [PTN repo (Bittensor subnet 8)](https://github.com/taoshidev/proprietary-trading-network/blob/main/docs/validator.md), which generates files accessible via this API. This is needed so that validators can provide PTN data to consumers. 

The Flask code can easily be modified to serve outputs from any other Bittensor subnet.


## Configuration
### Changing the API Key
The API uses a simple token-based authentication system. The default API key is set to "xxxx".
Change the default API key in the `accessible_api_keys` list in `serve.py` to a more secure key before deploying in a production environment to prevent unauthorized access.

### Making Server Accessible
By default, the server binds to `127.0.0.1` which only allows local requests. To allow access from any IP address, bind to `0.0.0.0`:
```python
serve(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=48888)
```

### Launching the server
On your validator, clone this repo in the same directory that the `proprietary-trading-network` repo is in, make desired edits, and then run
```bash
pm2 start serve.py --name serve
```

## Security Considerations
If you are using the repo as a standalone solution that does not leverage the [Request Network](https://request.taoshi.io/), you will need to consider several factors in your custom implementation.

### Rate Limiting
Consider implementing rate limiting using out of the box Flask extensions like `Flask-Limiter` or custom implementations to prevent abuse and ensure fair use of the API.

### HTTPS
Deploy the Flask application over HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit. This is typically done by placing the Flask application behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL/TLS termination.

### Firewall Configuration
Configure firewall rules to only allow traffic on necessary ports from trusted IP addresses.

## Available Endpoints

### All Miners Positions 

@app.route("/miner-positions", methods=["GET"])

This endpoint retrieves the positions of all miners, optionally filtered by a specified data freshness tier. The tier parameter can be one of the following values: ['0', '30', '50', '100'].

Parameters:
tier (optional): Specifies the data freshness tier.
* 0: 100% of positions show data with a 24-hour delay.
* 30: 30% of positions show real-time data, 70% show data with a 24-hour delay. (superset of tier 0)
* 50: 50% of positions show real-time data, 50% show data with a 24-hour delay. (superset of tier 30)
* 100: 100% of positions show real-time data. Equivalent to not providing a tier. (superset of tier 50)

If no tier is provided, the response will be a raw JSON file with the following schema:

Hotkeys are mapped to a data dict. The data dict contains positions which contain orders.

### Explanation of Schema:
* miner_hotkey: A unique identifier for a miner. This is the same as the Bittensor metagraph hotkey value.
* all_time_returns: The miner's total return on investment across all positions over all time.
* n_positions: The number of positions held by the miner.
* percentage_profitable: The proportion of the miner's positions that have been profitable.
* positions: A list of individual trading positions held by the miner.
* average_entry_price: The average price at which the miner entered the position.
* current_return: The current return on the position with no fees.
* return_at_close: The return on the position at the time it was closed with all fees applied.
* initial_entry_price: The price at which the position was first opened.
* is_closed_position: Indicates if the position is closed.
* net_leverage: The leverage currently used in the position. 0 if the position is closed.
* open_ms: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the position was opened.
* close_ms: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the position was closed. 0 if not closed.
* orders: A list of orders executed within the position.
    * leverage: The leverage applied to the order.
    * order_type: The type of order (e.g., SHORT, LONG, FLAT).
    * order_uuid: A unique identifier for the order.
    * price: The price at which the order was executed.
    * price_sources: Used for debugging. Info about the sources used to determine the price. At the time of this writing the sources are Polygon and TwelveData.
* processed_ms: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the order was processed.
* position_type: The current status of the position (e.g., FLAT, SHORT, LONG).
* position_uuid: A unique identifier for the position.
* trade_pair: Information about the trade pair (e.g., currency pair BTCUSD).

If a tier is provided, the response will be a gzipped JSON file with the above schema but with data freshness adjusted according to the specified tier. This allows different pricing tiers for data sales and enables more bandwidth-efficient data transfers due to gzip compression.


### Single Miner Positions

 @app.route("/miner-positions/<minerid>", methods=["GET"])

 Similar to the above endpoint but only returns the data dict for the specified hotkey. The returned payload is a raw json file.

### Miner Hotkeys

@app.route("/miner-hotkeys", methods=["GET"])

Returns all the hotkeys as seen in the metagraph from the validator's perspective.

### All Miners Statistics 

@app.route("/statistics", methods=["GET"])

Returns the statistic relevant for scoring miners. These statistics are also consumed by the Taoshi dashboard for visualization purposes.

### Single Miner Statistics 

@app.route("/statistics/<minerid>/", methods=["GET"])

Returns the statistic relevant for scoring the specified miner.

### Eliminations

@app.route("/eliminations", methods=["GET"])

Which miners are eliminated according to this validator. This is the same information visualized on the Taoshi dashboard.

Schema:

```
 "eliminations": [
    {
      "dd": 0.0,
      "elimination_initiated_time_ms": 1711184954891,
      "hotkey": "5Dk2u35LRYEi9SC5cWamtzRkdXJJDLES7gABuey6cJ6t1ajK",
      "reason": "LIQUIDATED"
    },
    {
      "elimination_initiated_time_ms": 1711204151504,
      "hotkey": "5G1iDH2gvdAyrpUD4QfZXATvGEtstRBiXWieRDeaDPRfPEcU",
      "reason": "PLAGIARISM"
    },
    {
```
As of writing, the only ways to be eliminated are:

* Being liquidated (portfolio value goes to 0)
* Plagiarizing another miner
* Failing the challenge period

More information can be found here: https://github.com/taoshidev/proprietary-trading-network/blob/main/docs/miner.md#miner

### Miner Copying

@app.route("/miner-copying", methods=["GET"])

Automatically-generated plagairsm scores per miner. Coming soon


### Validator Checkpoint 

@app.route("/validator-checkpoint", methods=["GET"])

Everything required for a validator to restore it's state when starting for the first time. This includes all miner positions as well as derived data such as perf ledgers, challenge period data, and eliminations. 

Perf ledger schema:

```bash
"perf_ledgers": {
    "5C5GANtAKokcPvJBGyLcFgY5fYuQaXC3MpVt75codZbLLZrZ": {
      "cps": [
        {
          "accum_ms": 21600000,
          "gain": 0.12586433994869853,
          "last_update_ms": 1714161050595,
          "loss": -0.12587360888356938,
          "n_updates": 17213,
          "open_ms": 21599768,
          "prev_portfolio_ret": 0.9999907311080851
        },
        {
          "accum_ms": 21600000,
          "gain": 0.017040557887505504,
          "last_update_ms": 1714182650595,
          "loss": -0.016984326534111933,
          "n_updates": 2219,
          "open_ms": 21599768,
          "prev_portfolio_ret": 1.0000469635212756
        },
        {
...
```
Perf ledgers are built based off realtime price data and are consumed in the scoring logic. More info in the PTN repo.

## Usage with curl
Example `curl` commands to interact with the Flask server. Replace `<server_ip>` with your validator's IP address and `xxxx` with your API key that you hardcode in `serve.py`

### Get All Miner Positions
```bash
curl -X GET http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"api_key": "xxxx"}' -o miner_positions.json
```

### Get All Miner Positions as a gz with a specified tier
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://<server_ip>:48888/miner-positions?tier=0' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"api_key": "xxxx"}' -o miner_positions.json.gz
```

### Get Validator Checkpoint
```bash
curl -X GET http://<server_ip>:48888/validator-checkpoint -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"api_key": "xxxx"}' -o validator_checkpoint.json
```

## Usage with Python
Example python code to interact with the Flask server.

### Get Validator Checkpoint with python

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'https://example.com/validator-checkpoint'
api_key = 'abcdefg'

data = {
'api_key': api_key
}
json_data = json.dumps(data)
headers = {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
test = requests.get(url, data=json_data, headers=headers)
print(test)
with open('validator_checkpoint.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(test.json()))
# print(json.loads(test.json()))

```

### Best practices when building trading logic
Parse the processed time of the order and compare it to the current time to decide if the order is fresh. Rarely, orders can be delayed.
Keep track of order uuids that have already been processed so that you can only process the newest orders.
Use the tiered positions endpoint with the .gz payload for optimal response times.


## Final Notes

The [Request Network](https://request.taoshi.io/) is a Taoshi product which serves subnet data while handling security, rate limiting, data customization, and provide a polished customer-facing and validator setup UI. Running this repo is a pre-req to serving data on the Request Network.
